## BitcoinDataRepository.java

This interface serves as a repository for managing BitcoinData entities. It extends JpaRepository, providing a set of standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations without the need for boilerplate code.

### Annotations 
- @Repository: This annotation is typically used in Spring to indicate that the class is a repository, though it's not explicitly used here as extending JpaRepository automatically provides this functionality.

### Interface
- public interface BitcoinDataRepository extends JpaRepository<BitcoinData, Long>:
  - **BitcoinData**: The entity type that the repository manages.
  - **Long**: The type of the entity's primary key.

### Methods
By extending JpaRepository, the BitcoinDataRepository inherits several methods for data manipulation, including but not limited to:
- save(S entity): Saves a given entity.
- findById(ID id): Retrieves an entity by its id.
- findAll(): Retrieves all entities.
- deleteById(ID id): Deletes the entity with the given id.

### Example Usage
This repository is used in the BitcoinDataService class to perform operations related to BitcoinData, such as fetching, saving, and deleting Bitcoin data records from the database.

### Additional Notes
By using Spring Data JPA, this repository benefits from automatic query generation based on method names, allowing for more intuitive data access methods.
