# Asset Management Application - Yahoo Finance Integration and Chatbot Overview

## Overview
In our asset management application, we focus on managing **Bitcoin**, **stocks**, and **gold**. To support data-driven insights and asset tracking, we integrate external data from sources like Yahoo Finance and use machine learning models to predict stock prices and inform investment strategies. Additionally, a chatbot feature is integrated to enhance user experience by providing on-demand insights and answering asset-related queries.

## Yahoo Finance Integration
Yahoo Finance serves as a primary data source for our stock-related information, offering up-to-date data on stock symbols, historical prices, and volume metrics. This integration supports the predictive capabilities of our application, providing essential inputs for stock price forecasting.

### Features:
- **Real-Time Data**: Yahoo Finance supplies real-time data on selected stocks, ensuring our predictions are based on the latest available information.
- **Historical Data**: Access to historical data helps in model training and analysis, supporting more robust trend detection and predictions.
- **Data Points**: Key indicators, such as **opening**, **closing**, **high**, **low prices**, and **volume**, provide a comprehensive view for stock analysis and prediction.

## Machine Learning Algorithms
The application employs specialized algorithms tailored for stock price prediction. For stock assets, **GridSearchCV** and **CatBoost** are applied for fine-tuned, high-accuracy forecasting. Different models and methodologies are used for predicting Bitcoin and gold trends.

### Stock Prediction Models:
- **GridSearchCV**: Optimizes hyperparameters in our machine learning pipeline, helping to identify the most effective model settings.
- **CatBoost**: An advanced boosting algorithm that effectively handles categorical data and complex datasets, delivering high prediction accuracy.

## Chatbot Integration
The chatbot feature provides users with a conversational interface for interacting with their asset portfolio, enhancing accessibility and user engagement.

# Chatbot Documentation

This chatbot is implemented using the Microsoft OpenAI API, providing conversational capabilities by interacting with users and responding intelligently to queries. The chatbot leverages the Microsoft OpenAI API key for secure access and communication with the model.

## Overview

The chatbot uses natural language processing (NLP) to interpret user input and generate relevant responses. With Microsoft’s OpenAI model, the chatbot can handle various conversational contexts, making it suitable for use cases such as customer support, information retrieval, and general inquiries.

## Key Components

### 1. **Microsoft OpenAI API Integration**
   - The chatbot connects to Microsoft’s OpenAI API to access large language models.
   - API Key: The integration requires an API key from Microsoft OpenAI, which ensures secure and authenticated access.
   - Endpoint: A predefined API endpoint provided by Microsoft is used to send requests and receive responses.

### 2. **Chatbot Engine**
   - **Request Handler**: Sends requests to the OpenAI API with user prompts.
   - **Response Processor**: Interprets the OpenAI API’s responses and formats them for display to the user.
   - **Session Management**: Maintains context within a conversation, allowing the chatbot to remember previous interactions for a coherent multi-turn dialogue.

## Setup Instructions

1. **API Key Configuration**
   - Obtain the OpenAI API key from Microsoft Azure’s OpenAI service.
   - Set up the environment variable for the API key (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`) to ensure secure storage.
   - Ensure that the key has appropriate permissions for the required model and endpoint.

2. **Environment Setup**
   - Install necessary libraries for HTTP requests and JSON parsing (e.g., `requests`, `json` for Python).
   - Set up the project environment (virtual environment recommended) and install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

3. **Endpoint Configuration**
   - Define the base URL for the Microsoft OpenAI API endpoint.
   - Set up the request parameters, including:
     - Model type (e.g., `gpt-4`)
     - Temperature, max tokens, and other model parameters for response control.

## Usage

1. **Initiate a Chat Session**
   - Start the chatbot by running the main script. The chatbot listens for user input and sends it to the OpenAI API.
   
2. **User Input & Responses**
   - The chatbot processes each user query, sends it to the API, and retrieves the response.
   - It displays the response to the user and can handle follow-up questions within the same session context.

3. **Error Handling**
   - Includes error-handling mechanisms to manage API request failures or invalid inputs.
   - Common errors include invalid API key, network issues, or exceeding token limits, which are logged for troubleshooting.

## Security Considerations

- **API Key Security**: Store the API key securely, using environment variables or a secure vault.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations, especially when handling sensitive user data.
- **Rate Limits**: Monitor usage to avoid rate limiting or unexpected costs.

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication Errors**: Verify the API key and permissions.
- **Response Latency**: Adjust model parameters or reduce token length to improve response time.
- **Error Logging**: Log all API interactions and error responses for analysis and debugging.
